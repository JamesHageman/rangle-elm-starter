# unofficial rangle-elm-starter

This repo is a port of Rangle.io's [react-redux-starter](https://github.com/rangle/react-redux-starter) to elm. 
It was forked directly from the react-redux-starter repo and still contains the 
redux implementation.

This is a WIP :)

## Getting Started

First, install elm globally:

```bash
npm install -g elm
```

Then install all of the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JamesHageman/rangle-elm-starter
npm install
elm package install
```

And start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev:elm
```

And open `localhost:8081` in your browser.


### TODO
- Production builds
- Unit tests with elm-test
- e2e tests with robot
- Remove the redux implementation
